# MailManagementSystem

## Overview
The "MailManagementSystem" is a university project that simulates the management of a physical mail facility through a client-server application. This repository showcases various design patterns to demonstrate their practical use in software development.

## Purpose
The purpose of the "MailManagementSystem" is to serve as an academic tool to illustrate the implementation of design patterns. This project was developed primarily for educational reasons, focusing on the application of design patterns, and it is not intended to be a fully functional or market-ready software product.

## Design Patterns Used
In this project, several design patterns have been incorporated to improve the modularity, reusability, and scalability of the application. These include:
- **Observer Pattern**: For real-time updates in the shipment status to clients.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Added to the `Package` class to dynamically append behaviors.
- **Builder Pattern**: Simplifies the construction process in the `Package` and `Letter` classes.
- **DAO Pattern**: Encapsulates all data source interactions.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Manages the cloning of content in client-side tabs.

## Features
- Robust user authentication (login and registration).
- Distinct views tailored for admins, clients, and employees.
- Real-time display of package and shipment data.
- Notifications on shipment updates via the Observer pattern.
- Prototypical displays in client interfaces.

## Project Status
The "MailManagementSystem" is currently in a development phase and is used as a demonstrative project for applying design patterns. It was created to meet the academic objectives of demonstrating these patterns in software development rather than being a complete commercial product.
